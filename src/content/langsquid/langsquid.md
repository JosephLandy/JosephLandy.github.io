My old friend Fraser Fuite is an enthusiastic innovator in language education. After returning from a year teaching English in Taiwan, he came back with many ideas to improve the experience of learning languages for both children and adults. Starting in December 2019, I did some work with him on a website (langsquid.com) for his idea to use engaging, crowd sourced stories aimed at older children and adults to teach chinese characters and vocabulary. Repeated words would be progressively replaced with their translations and the user could mouse over the new word for its translation, somewhat like DuoLingo. The plan was to use WordPress to try and develop simple prototypes to test out and develop the concept itself before looking into a more complicated tech solution that would allow us to integrate more features. 

Although the project stalled, and hasn't really been developed extensively yet, I got some experience working with Wordpress, using PHP for the first time to develop a simple plugin as well as handling the general process of setting up, hosting and configuring a simple website, like purchasing a domain name and configuring SSL.
