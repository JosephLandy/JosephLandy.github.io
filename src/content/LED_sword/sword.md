This is a sword I made to take to two large music festivals in the summer of 2019. The cross guard and housing for the electronics were 3d printed and the blade uses an animated strip of LEDs controlled with a small arduino in a polycarbonate tube to diffuse the light. The sword is powered with a lithium ion battery and recharged via USB. I initially intended to use a much higher density LED strip, and I had to substitute a less dense one I had on hand. The result was still impressive, but I'm planning on replacing it with the full density strip soon. 

You can find a list of parts and the blender files on Github. 

It was a really fun change to build something more physical and I'm quite proud of the result.

The design of the cross guard is based on the famous Master Sword from the Legend of Zelda games, titles I have fond memories of from childhood. All the components were modelled in blender, and 3d printed at the SparQ maker space at Queen's. 

By far the most difficult part of the project was designing the housing for the electronics. It had to be in as small a form factor as possible, and I needed to be able to open and close it to access and install the electronic components. The duct tape you can see in the picture is not a repair job, it was actually part of the design from the start. I didn't trust any mechanism I could easily 3d print to securely hold the casing in it's closed position. 

The project survived two multi-day camping music festivals largely unscathed.
