I am well aware that todo lists are considered the most boring project possible, practically a "hello world". But I LOVE todo lists. I am also generally unsatisfied with the various free and commercial todo list programs I've used. At various points in my life, I've been struck by the urge to develop the todo list app to end all todo list apps - at least for me.

This was also the first project I developed with react and I used Redux for state management, it was a good learning experience implementing some relatively complicated features. 

I never finished developing this project, primarily because I realized how much effort and development it would take to build a todo list with all the features I would want. In particular, I never implemented a backend so tasks added to the todo list are not persisted.
