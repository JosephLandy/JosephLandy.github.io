In October 2019 I participated in [Hack for Heritage](https://www.hack4heritage.com/), an AR/VR hackathon in Kingston Ontario themed around projects that would preserve, reflect or comment on cultural heritage. My team's project was a program for recording and experiencing stories around a virtual campfire. The idea was that the storyteller could animate props that symbolicly represent elements of the story.
