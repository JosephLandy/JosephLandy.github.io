The BioMotion 

I built this tool for the BioMotion Lab in 2018 to generate input files for a new motion capture method they were adopting. Motion capture markers had to be labelled and mapped to a vertex index on a mesh. It would have been somewhat simpler to build the tool using a 3d program such as Blender, but since everyone was using Unity at the time, it made more sense to build it in Unity.
