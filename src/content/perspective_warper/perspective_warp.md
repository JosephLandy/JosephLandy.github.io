[Try it out for yourself!](https://josephlandy.github.io/perspectivewarp)

I encountered a function while learning openCV to remove perspective distortion from a feature viewed at an angle in an image and decided to try implementing it myself in JavaScript. It was a quick(ish) project that helped me explore different math libraries in JavaScript, and keep my linear algebra skills sharp. I used bilinear interpolation to improve the image quality of the output.

The somewhat extreme, but also surprisingly consistent perspectives applied to photos of buildings in particular are quite interesting and fun to play around with. The results remind me somewhat of Dal√≠ and surrealism.
